## Features

### 1. Automatic Tipi Updates

Tipi Tricks can automatically check for and install updates for Tipi, ensuring you always have the latest features and security enhancements.

### 2. Automatic App Updates

Keep your applications up-to-date effortlessly. Tipi Tricks automates the process of checking for and applying updates to the apps installed within your Tipi environment.

### 3. Automatic System Updates

Maintain system security and performance with automatic system updates. Tipi Tricks ensures that your operating system receives the latest patches and upgrades without manual intervention.

### 4. Automatic Backups

Protect your data with regular, automated backups. Tipi Tricks schedules and performs backups, allowing you to restore your system to a previous state in case of any issues.

### 5. Mountpoint Monitoring

Tipi Tricks monitors your mountpoints from `/etc/fstab`, providing alerts (with gotify-cli) if any mountpoints become unavailable. It can stop Tipi containers that require data from the missing mountpoints and automatically restart them when the mountpoints become available again. Apps that will be stopped can be configured in `runtipi/etc/monitor_shares.conf`.

### 6. Space Monitoring

Stay informed about your systemâ€™s storage status. Tipi Tricks monitors disk space usage and alerts you when space is running low, helping you avoid potential system slowdowns or crashes. The notification threshold can be configured in `runtipi/etc/monitor_space.conf`. Tipi is set to stop if the install drive reaches 99% capacity and will resume once space is below 99%.

### 7. Temperature Monitoring

Dynamically scan for temperature sensors and allow the user to choose the sensor to monitor. Tipi Tricks can trigger user-defined actions if the sensor's temperature exceeds the user-defined threshold.

### 8. Clearing Docker Cache

Reclaim valuable disk space by clearing the Docker cache.

### 9. Optional Notifications

Receive timely notifications about system events and statuses if the gotify-cli is installed and configured.
